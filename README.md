# 32_bit_floating_point
I have implemented an IEEE paper "Design and performance evaluation of approximate floating point multipliers".
I have implemented this paper for 32 bit (or single precision) floating point number.
I have hereby added all the verilog files that were created in the process of implementation of this paper.
I have also attached the testbench that was used to simulate the code.
